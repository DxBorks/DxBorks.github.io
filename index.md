The DxBorks operating system was a year long quest for success. Born from the will to create a minimalistic kernel for x86 devices, it evolved into an actual project with lots of possibilities, while keeping its “proof of concept” feel rather than being a commercial operating system. Licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3, everyone is free to use this OS as they wish, as long as they don’t prevent other users from experiencing the same freedom.

DxBorks is a rather minimalistic software. It followed a paradygm important to my eyes: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) a paradygm used by lots of developers, engineers, and other individuals designing complex pieces of hardware or software, including the Arch Linux development team or US army engineers.

This paradygm prioritises simplicity over complexity: a piece of code should be easy enough to understand to remove the need for an extensive use of commentaries. The “UNIX Philosophy” has also been a quite fundamental aspect of the project: a tool should do a single thing, and do it well. In our case, the tools are functions, variables, algorithms, etc.

Overhaul, DxBorks is just another kernel inspired by UNIX, while keeping its school project feel.
